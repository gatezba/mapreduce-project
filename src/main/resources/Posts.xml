Squatted and taken names,&#xA;however clever, are not helpful. You&#xA;can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whois.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;whois.net&lt;/a&gt; to check&#xA;availability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Post one domain per answer. This&#xA;makes the voting process much easier.&#xA;If domains are very similar (e.g.&#xA;&quot;game&quot; and &quot;games&quot;), they can be in&#xA;the same answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make sure the domain wasn't already&#xA;suggested. To search within this&#xA;question, use a search query such as:&#xA;inquestion:1 &quot;example.com&quot; replacing&#xA;example.com with the domain to search&#xA;for&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/domain-names/&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange FAQ: Domain Names&lt;/a&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Please don’t think that it’s necessary to use a domain name that reflects something going wrong. We picked the name “Stack Overflow” because it has some meaning for real programmers, not because it reflected a bug or problem. “Super User” is just as good a name. I get depressed by all these suggestions of “BurntChicken.com”, “LostYarmulke.com”, and “FallenArches.com” (for former owners of McDonald’s franchises, of course).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look for jargon that has meaning to the group of people you want to attract. Insider jargon is the duck call of insiders. Look at me! If I can say “contributory negligence,” I must be a real lawyer!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;.coms are a million times better than other TLDs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A domain name should be readable over the phone. Even on AT&amp;amp;T Wireless. Tricky spellings are always a bad idea. Similarly, dashes reek of desperation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Long names are not the end of the world. Using two or three words (or a couple of digits) is a good way to find available domains.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Or see section 4 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/&quot;&gt;our own meta FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's try to brainstorm for some concise, bicycle-related and easily identifiable jargon per Domain Name FAQ #2. If we use a word (or words) unique to bicycling, we'll more likely be able to secure a .com domain name without paying a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we should avoid very common terminology (Bike/Cycle/Cyclist/Bicycle) and terminology not specific to bicycling (Rider/Wheel/Velocity/Tire/Chain).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, when posting a new suggestion, please use this format:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;**FooBar.com** - ([Not Registered][1])&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.whois.net/whois/foobar.com&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:19:25.967" LastActivityDate="2010-10-09T00:20:45.407" Title="Suggest a domain name" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;essential-meta-questions&gt;" AnswerCount="25" CommentCount="11" ClosedDate="2010-10-08T22:34:22.257" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-08-25T19:51:38.343" />

The ride hasn't ended when you put your feet on the ground, nor necessarily when you lock the bike up (hence a question about locks would be OK), but when you are ready to begin the next non-biking activities such as work.  Where you are staying on tour would be that next activity as well. Questions about how to clean your bike would also be on topic.  How about a question about what type of sleeping bag would you suggest for touring - to me that is off topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="106" LastActivityDate="2010-08-30T14:33:55.510" CommentCount="0" />

Fewer overall, but still some.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 90 day beta evaluation time period is in 2 days.  Don't worry about it: I think we're doing well on providing solid timely answers to questions, and I think the SE team can understand that a site about cycling will have some seasonality to it and give us a few more months.  (I'd suggest we ask for pushing the final evaluation off until mid-April if the question comes up)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think what we should concentrate on is making the site work well, and prepare ourselves for increased traffic come spring:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote&lt;/strong&gt;. Vote good answers and good questions up.  For bad ones maybe comment to give the poster a chance to improve, but vote them down when they're bad (you can always change your vote if the post changes).  The site works on an economy of reputation points that are earned through votes on good questions and answers.  The more people writing good answers get reputation points, the more there's people that can help run the site, which will be important when there's more traffic come spring, and especially important when we get out of beta.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a question can be improved, suggest or edit.

It may be specific enough that nobody but the original questioner will ever find the answer useful. A year or two from now the answer will be wrong because the manufacturer stops making that model (or that particular shop drops it).  It's basically a shopping answer that might be better answered with links to the websites of tire manufacturers that make tires with a stripe of color.  I didn't close the question when I first saw it, but if I'd seen a vote or two to close I might've.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least in theory, answers to questions about putting a Trek ABP bike on a trainer could apply to other rear suspension bikes being put onto a trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't want to close the more general &quot;part X in Y color&quot; type questions systematically, but unless the color is silver or black it is likely to be an answer that's not much use to many other people. So depending on specifics my opinion could go either way on questions like that.  Something a little more general like &quot;part X in different color choices&quot; would be a bit better, especially if it led to answers with multiple choices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It always depends on the specifics, but I would think that a question like &quot;I have X derailer, will Y shifters work&quot; would be a good question that I'd want to see left open. The ideal answer wouldn't be &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;if you add Z part&quot;, it would tell how to tell what shifter would work with that type of derailer.  Even better would be to change the question to that slightly more general case: &quot;I have X derailer, how do I tell what shifter will work with it?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to try to steer away from too much straight out product recommendations.  If product recommendations have to happen I'd prefer to see a selection instead of a single one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of questions about how to build a bike, though.  And I get that there's details where some specific product recommendations are hard to avoid.  The questions that are about trying to learn instead of what the best part is are going to be much better, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, there was a recent post on the Stackoverflow blog about this kind of question:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A is Hard, Let's Go Shopping!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I think some of the issues with the shopping type questions aren't as applicable to bicycles because the technology isn't changing as fast as computers and electronics.  However, specific product recommendations are still unlikely to be useful for more than a couple years, since all the bikes and parts seem to change every year or two (even if just to nearly equivalent new model).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do think there can be a bit more value to some bicycle product recommendations than, say, electronics product recommendations: there are bike parts under $50 (such as tires) that can make a huge difference and are very hard to find any kind of reviews or details, even who makes parts like what you're looking for.

Here is a very brief summary of the discussion: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are many people visiting the site but people are losing interest because there are not enough questions to answer.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The low hanging fruit is being picked.  Soon there will not be an extremely large amount of questions to ask.  This is different that SO since the biking technology is changing much more slowly and I think in general because questions are less complex.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that the main problem with allowing regional questions is they are usually not relevant to users from different regions.  To solve this we need some form of filtering mechanism.  Ideally having some built in method would be great but in the meantime I think we should just start using tags.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that all regional questions should be tagged with: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tag: &lt;code&gt;regional&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tag: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Country&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; ie: &lt;code&gt;Canada&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tag: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Provence/State&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; ie: &lt;code&gt;Ontario&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tag: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Closest Major City&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; ie: &lt;code&gt;Ottawa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some questions may not require all tags.  For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Where can I order used bike parts online in Canada?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - would only require the &lt;code&gt;regional&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Canada&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What is a best two day trail to do within 6 hours Ottawa?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - would require the &lt;code&gt;regional&lt;/code&gt; tag, the &lt;code&gt;Canada&lt;/code&gt; tag, the &lt;code&gt;Ontario&lt;/code&gt; tag, and the &lt;code&gt;Quebec&lt;/code&gt; tag.  (Ottawa is on the border of Quebec and Ontario so both provence tags would apply).  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Where can I find a 27 inch tube in Halifax?&quot; would be tagged: &lt;code&gt;regional&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Halifax&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Canada&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The logic about what questions to show users seems pretty simple too.  Seems to me: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(regionalTag)&#xA;    if(userDisplayAllRegions)&#xA;        display question in list; &#xA;    else&#xA;        if(countryTag == usersCountryTag)&#xA;            if(provenceTag == usersProvenceTag)&#xA;                if(cityTag == usersCityTag)&#xA;                   display question in list; &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But maybe we are not allowed to touch the code.

I'd expect this to be the most typical question we'll get, in fact.

Or maybe not: maybe there are some questions like, &quot;How do I build a wheel?&quot;, that would take too much explanation to answer properly?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would you suggest as examples of answers which meet the FAQ criteria but are 'too basic'?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also suggest that for as long as Bicycles is relatively low-traffic and wants to welcome new users, you can afford to allow even basic questions, as long as the questions are 'high quality' in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not one of your expert users though, so beware; a different point of view is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/258/what-does-self-support-mean-during-touring/262#262&quot;&gt;you mustn't drown out what expert-to-expert conversation there is&lt;/a&gt; (however you interpret/perceive 'drown out').&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of 'community' and 'experts': when I said above that &quot;programmers are supposed to know the first thing about what they're doing&quot; I meant that, IMO, 'professional and enthusiast programmers' ought to know about using e.g. Google to find a tutorial and/or reference to introduce the elementary use of any given programming language. If someone doesn't do that, then they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/faq&quot;&gt;arguably not &quot;a programmer&quot; at all as described in the first sentence of the StackOverflow FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the audience for Bicycles is defined as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: I'm not aware of questions about bicycles that could be so &quot;basic&quot; as to prove that the questioner isn't a member of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; group. Here the FAQ allows commuters (bicycle users), as well as builders. The corresponding programming forums are split into several distinct forums (one forum for narrow coding questions, another for more subjective how-to-be-a-programmer questions, another for server administrators, another for UI designers, another for computer end-users, etc.). This forum, with a wider audience, a broader range of experience, might therefore invite a wider range of questions (including some more 'basic' questions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1097" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:40:12.510" LastActivityDate="2011-02-24T03:34:15.393" CommentCount="11" />

In other words, when you see &quot;Which jacket should I buy?&quot;, pretend they're asking how to pick a jacket for their particular needs and provide that type of information. Maybe include a few specific product recommendations with the reasons for them related to the general reasons. Even bad questions are likely to be left open if they have an awesome answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even better, edit the question into the better question that we wish they had asked.

Is what you're writing likely to get better answers to what the original author wants to know? Is it making this site better? Will it keep the question fro getting closed, or help it get re-opened?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange text is both creative-commons licensed and the site is a wiki, so users with sufficient rep can edit whatever they feel will help the site, making whatever changes are needed. They'll understand, of course. And hey, they can always revert, yes? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uh, no. It's not that simple, unless you want to alienate people. I'd be a little peeved is someone significantly changed what I was saying. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the reason a question is becoming much removed from the original question is that the &quot;editor&quot; has a lot of stuff to say on the topic. Or... is the problem that the original question had too &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; to say, or that you have too &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; to say? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm an editor for a living, and I have to keep in mind that &lt;em&gt;this is not my work&lt;/em&gt;, and that &lt;em&gt;these are not my words&lt;/em&gt;. I'm trying to help the author say what they want to say, but make the novel &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. If I cant do that when I get sample chapters, maybe that means the original text is unsalvageable and I shouldn't accept the project. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly: If the question starts becoming more your own question, perhaps it'd be best to vote to close (or leave it closed) and simply write your own question on the subject. We can have multiple varieties of the same question open, as long as they are clearly different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If things are uncertain, we can leave a question closed until we figure out what to do with it. &quot;Closed&quot; is, I think, an unfortunate term. What it really means is that a question can;t be answered. &quot;Frozen&quot; might be a better term, but I think we're stuck with things as they are for now. We can close a question, discuss it here, make it better (with the buy-in of the original author), then re-open. Or we may decide it's best to leave it closed and try again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think there's a point where one is editing too much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, people with the reputation scores to edit should also have the good judgement to either know where that line is, or to use all their resources to find it--i.e., to ask for help or community consensus. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastActivityDate="2011-06-06T02:05:30.453" CommentCount="0" />

There are multiple answers, and different answers might work in seemingly identical situations. The people who are looking for help on this issue are also likely to try multiple answers, and to read as many answers as it takes to get what they want. So if we end up with 20 different answers that's actually a good thing. Also, different people will know of difference resources that are broadly similar and it would be better if they were added to one answer rather than scattered through multiple equivalent answers (I'm sure my bike bus suggestion has parallels in other countries, although here BikeSaint stole it from the &quot;walking bus&quot; community).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm cautious because of the herd voting effect, where the answers at the top of the rankings attract disproportionately more votes over time, making later answers unlikely to ever get more than a few votes.

If what you would have to correct would change the character of the answer, though, this may not be the best option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can leave a competing answer. You can get more people to look at your answer by publicizing the question (or your answer, if you want) on Twitter and Facebook.

A question can be badly phrased, and this can encourage quick, incorrect answers. You can combat this by making questions into better questions early on in the process. You can comment on the questions, submit edits to the question, or even vote to close &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt;, possibly with an eye towards re-opening the question later when it's been improved. (Close votes on beta sites currently require 500 rep or higher.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that information in an answer is wrong enough to harm somebody's safety, please do bring it to the attention of the mods by flagging it.

I was looking for bike reviews, but perhaps that's somewhat out of scope for an SE site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The position I find myself in currently: There are say 6 new bikes I'm considering, and I'm looking for insights beyond what I can glean from spec sheets and test rides - what living with those bikes is like for months or years. I can pose that as a big super-question or 6 more-specific questions.  I'm not sure what response I'd get though, nor how long it might take to get owners to contribute a review's worth of answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The position I'll be in in a year: I will have bought and ridden bike X for 6 months, and I intend to write a review of both how I narrowed the field and chose the bike, as well as how I'm liking that bike. I would post that to a couple bike forums, but I'd also be willing to post it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I find myself wishing Bicycles.se held a union of all forums' review threads (cleaned up and voted into best-answer form) - that's what I'm looking for right now. So that's why I'm curious at the complete lack of bike reviews here currently.  This seems like the best forum-spanning place to centralize and aggregate that information - but maybe not?  I realize reviews are probably not a big part of most SE sites' traffic (&quot;practical, answerable questions&quot;), but they seem very near and dear to most bikers' interests. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should I ask 6 specific &quot;what's your experience with bike X?&quot; questions, or a combo question, or don't ask at all?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should I eventually post a review of my bike selection process?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Should I eventually post a review of bike X?

Any effort to create an index of forum reviews would be a time-consuming process and would get out of date quickly. It would also be shoehorning a use into a SE site that it wasn't designed to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where this site &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be of use:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicycles.SE can help you make decisions on specific questions that come up while deciding on a bike. Are you considering a suspension fork? Are you undecided between a carbon or an aluminum frame? What about disc wheels on road bikes? What kinds of brakes should you look for? And so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You asked about how a bike will age: That might be a question all on its own. &quot;How can I determine how well a bike will stand up over the years?&quot;, perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain models seem to be compared to other models with regularity, for example, the Trek 520 and the Surly LHT are often held up to each other. The Bike Friday Tikit and the Brompton are often similarly compared. (Et cetera.) Asking questions about the advantages and disadvantages of bikes that inevitably get compared sounds great, as long as the question focuses on the &quot;why&quot;. (The 520 is easier to get ahold of to test-ride, the LHT is easier to configure; the Brommie folds smaller, but the Tikit can carry more cargo.) However, keep in mind that these bikes change a bit every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I'd save &quot;Which bike should I buy&quot; questions for the forums. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you would prefer, you could always post draft questions to Meta first if you want people to help you refine them a bit before posting on the main site, or even ask about it in chat.

In fact this advice should be better than that because of the variety of opinion, short-cuts and tips that only come with experience, all distilled with the voting system into quality answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also no financial reason to give answers that 'cost more money', e.g. on a recent question on straightening out handlebars, in a retail environment you would sell the customer the bars, fresh tape and go for the novelty bell, hopefully to get a good chunk of the customer's wallet, leaving them with a big job putting their bars back together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, on SE you can say 'get a big bit of wood and try straightening them out' - potentially a five minute task with no money changing hands. To suggest this in a retail setting to a customer is potentially a sackable offence as saving customers money is morally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the above example, I see Bicycles.SE as hopefully becoming the de-facto place on the web to learn everything and anything about how to fix/repair a bike, a 'virtual mechanic's brain' where the 'virtual mechanic' has wisdom of the crowds and is never too busy to help out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for the blog idea...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I dislike the existing bike sites that 'cater' for cyclists. In the UK I particularly dislike the 'BikeRadar' effort of 'History Publishing' - it smells of car-driving-out-of-preference-types that just ended up in dead-tree publishing and their attempt at trying to put something together that might catch the cycling crowd. It has no soul, it talks down and second-guesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have little or no interest in the 'pro' cycling websites (outside of the three weeks of July Tour de France when I read all the gossip I can get). Given how many pro websites there are I think this segment is catered for adequately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mountain biking specific websites/magazines/blogs get my goat a bit. I see the whole MTB craze of the 90's as a reaction to the motor-mania of the last century, although great fun, going off-road is admitting defeat on using bikes for regular transport. We don't have to do that now, we don't have bikes 'just for fun', they are transport not-just for children and people who got nicked drink-driving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sites I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like are things like the cycle-porn-in-Copenhagen stuff, the reviews of cafes-by-bike website and &lt;em&gt;that sort of stuff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I would like to see in a SE blog is coupled to what SE is primarily going to be about, which is Q+A, which is 'virtual mechanic'. I may have misunderstood this 'mission', however, it is compatible with what a lot of other cycling orgs are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people doing outreach, the people into tours, the people into culture and products, all of them could do with some add-on reference for the 'how do I do this' questions. Venerable organisations such as the UK's Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) should give up on their own forums and CMS and direct the questions to Bicycles.SE, just because it is the superior platform for that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So anyway...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see the blog be put together with contributors from outside Bicycles.SE, for example, Louise from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patisseriecyclisme.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.patisseriecyclisme.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write something fantastic, not really to plug her site but to nonetheless get more traffic. Next week we could invite someone else to put together a guest post, the Copenhagen Cycling Chic -guy.&#xA;Again, a thinking-persons essay without any of the commercialism, patronising 'you-must-wear-helmet-obey-motorist' attitude, 'I ride bike style road/fixie/DH MTB/my-tri-bars-are-bigger-than-yours' snobbery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Invites to guest write for the Bicycles.SE blog should be a core part of the blog start, however, I think we need to be able to summarize our mission so that people see what we are trying to do and are therefore keen to write quality articles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blog could also be a place for nurturing quality writing talent. I know some people can write their journey to work as an epic tale of struggle against adversity with beginning, middle and end. I also know some people that can go all the way around the world and have nothing to say about it. So the subject is sometimes secondary to a good read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blog can also be a place where questions that were particularly well responded to get re-posted, to not get buried. The 'editors picks' as it were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for bike reviews, I think these could be really good if people are talking about the pride and joy they just bought, as opposed to salesman speak or depressed-journalist-speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rarely are blogs made from lots of guest posts, nobody even thinks about guest blogging for somewhere.

Maybe the comment mentioned something about the question that wasn't there any more (maybe a typo was edited out of the question), or a comment reading &quot;this question is extremely unclear&quot; when the question is perfectly clear. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are cases where a comment pointed out a problem with a questions, and the question was fixed. Do those comments have any reason at all to exist any longer? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've been quite against the idea of deleting comments at all. It seems like it's important to show new users how the site works: Leave a comment about a problem, the problem will get fixed. It shows new users how the system works, it's clear, and it's transparent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I recently came across this Q&amp;amp;A thread over on Meta Stack Overflow: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments&quot;&gt;Should moderators delete “make correction… done” comments?&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77374#77374&quot;&gt;currently-most-upvoted answer&lt;/a&gt; says, in effect, that such comments should be removed, and that most users probably would be okay with that. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77373/should-moderators-delete-make-correction-done-comments/77379#77379&quot;&gt;next most popular answer&lt;/a&gt; says that we should be extremely careful, since comment deletion is, to paraphrase, completely untransparent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What that means is that if a mod or high-rep user deletes a comment, we don't see that there's a deleted comment unless we click on the moderator menu and dig for it. So, if I go and delete a comment like &quot;Should be &lt;strong&gt;pedal&lt;/strong&gt; not &lt;strong&gt;peddle&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; after fixing the typo, it'll be more or less gone for good. If the original user didn't like that, I do have the ability to copy-paste the text and send it that user but I don't have the power to restore the comment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to suggest that we try this out on a trial basis, being very conservative about this. How about this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you see a comment mentioning an obvious typo, flag it for a mod and we'll delete it, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if it's an incredibly obvious, simple case of comment clutter. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If there's any kind of discussion going on, we'll leave things alone. If the two users involved in a discussion want it deleted, should we agree to do that? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, I'd be more comfortable with this if the request came from the original comment author. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like the title says, who's bothered by a long comment thread and would want it pruned?

Here are my thoughts on the second point. TLDR: It could go either way, I think a wiki would be slightly less useful than individual questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A community wiki about repair procedures &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; work. In order to be continually useful, though, it would have to be something that is useful as a reference as well as something that wouldn't work as individual questions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For examples, let's go with the terminology index. It's useful because (1) there's good information there, and (2) most of these entries wouldn't be good questions on their own, or at least would have to be expanded quite a bit. In the wiki, we can put down a brief entry, enough to at least get someone started on understanding the term in question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would a similar index of repair procedures structured like the terminology index work? Well, it might. They'd have to be brief, and would often tend to get larger and more detailed over time. If you're just talking about a list of procedures and the estimated times to perform them, that would be useful and fit well into a wiki. However, people would naturally add more information over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More detailed overviews of complex jobs like &quot;How do I repack my bearings&quot; or &quot;How do I size a replacement stem&quot; would probably work better as questions on their own, perhaps questions tagged with something like [repar-job-overview]. We'd get several different takes on each one, the best ones would be voted to the top, and--most importantly in my view--people would get rewarded with reputation when they're upvoted, so there's more incentive to provide good answers. We have a lot of wrenchers on this site. I'm sure that these questions would get good answers! Maybe we could even find a way to use the blog for this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, if you decide the site would be best off with a repair procedure community wiki, go for it.

However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise? &#xA;As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice.

Anything that sounds otherwise is really really minor details. If we go live with this design exactly like this I'd be happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the logo, it basically says &quot;I love bikes&quot; to me, which is a sentiment I can go for. I won't be surprised if some people don't like a heart as a logo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole design is a wee bit whimsical, which I like and some won't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think maybe you were thinking of a sort of &quot;vintage&quot; thing with the texture, but it also reminds me of a road surface, which is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the most part your design is about riding the bike, while most of our questions are about the mechanics of the bike.  The design looks more like riding on a day off than any kind of commute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tiny nits/suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The two &quot;screenshots&quot; have a different background blue color fade going on.  Is that on purpose?  Either color scheme is fine, but I slightly prefer the shades on the question view.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/users/605/jay-bazuzi&quot;&gt;@JayBazuzi&lt;/a&gt; pointed out in the comments above, the cyclist is hunched over. It would hurt less to look at that cyclist if they had a straighter back. While it is common to see cyclists hunched over like that, the preferred posture is bending at the hips and keeping your back fairly straight. (because that gives the muscles in your torso more leverage making it easier to keep weight off of your hands, because it's generally better for your back, and in some cases because it's more aerodynamic).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The more I stare at the design, the more it feels like riding on an oppressively hot day where the sun beats down and there's no shade. Maybe a tree somewhere? Or a hint of some water somewhere? I get thirsty looking at the pages&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I like the &quot;road sign&quot; details, and was thinking having the accepted answer number highlight look like one would be nice.  I'm thinking specifically a european advisory speed limit sign (I believe Australia uses the same scheme) which is white text on a square blue background (rounded corners) with or without a thin white border, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_380.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_380.svg&lt;/a&gt; or the 130 on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_393.svg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zeichen_393.svg&lt;/a&gt; (the red circles are mandatory speed limits). (but with a blue that fits the rest of the color scheme better, of course)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I kinda wish the decoration on tags made me think of bicycles in some way... Maybe something that looks a bit like the downtube company branding some manufacturers use. Most bikes the downtube branding is just straight contrasting color lettering/logos on the frame, but there's a classic style some use where that part of the tube is a different color (often with a little striping at both ends).

It reminds us that we are all here because we have one thing in common, at least. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's rider centric, and not machine centric only. It doesn't leave anyone with the impression that all we care about is what you ride, or how much it cost.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It does a good job of incorporating bicycle based elements without every button being a mini component of some kind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I hate the heart as logo. I'm not a 13 year old girl drawing the headbadge of my bike on my Peachie cover, and I don't want to look like one. I would be embarrassed to use that as a logo or link badge on most sites I frequent. And while I don't want to prevent 13 year old girls from participating, neither do I want to turn over our brand identity to one. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would much prefer our logo to look like a headbadge, or some similar cycling themed item. C'mon, it's our logo! Shouldn't it define &lt;strong&gt;bicycles&lt;/strong&gt;.se better than that? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'd like there to be some element that reminds us that there is a technical side to cycling; that riding is gestalt of man and machine, and that in a way cyclists the original cyborgs. This captures the zen side of cycling quite well. What about the other side? Are we ignoring it? Because most of our questions are far more focused on the technical than the zen of it all...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As was stated in the earlier answer, fix the cyclist's position. He looks in pain.

I think that, as far as bikes are concerned, you should take note of how much more sophisticated and high-tech bikes are than anything else on the roads. Carbon fibre is commonplace on bikes, not so on cars, they are stuck on steel and only just dabbling with aluminium which is old-tech for bikes. Bikes also can have electronic gears and time-trial machines use every aerodynamic trick in the wind-tunnel-hand-book. Fabrics for cycle clothing are also light years ahead of anything in the High Street or catwalk. LED lights were pioneered on bikes and are just making their way onto cars. Put simply, although we all have childhood memories of cycling, cycling is essentially a high-tech game with nothing vintage about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Solo cyclist'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been out and about on the bike today and I could not help but notice how many people were cycling in groups. When it is sunny weather it seems there are more people in groups than going solo. I think that the site is about community and that could be reflected by a diverse selection of riders on different styles of bikes. Inclusiveness is part of what the questions and answers are about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why Off-road?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The majority of questions on the site seem to be from people that ride for a mix of utility and pleasure. I personally view off-road mountain-biking as a bit 1980's, nowadays bikes are to be found in the city and along canal towpaths rather than off-road, as was the fashion when the 'car was king'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with sky blue skies?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Call me picky, but I like blue skies to be blue. Can we experiment with some different gradients? 'Simpsons' title sequence has a blue sky that is blue sky colour, as does the view out of my window now. There are lots of blues that say sky, I am just not feeling it with this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heart Logo and buttons&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the heart logo, however I feel we could do a bit more with the existing bicycle road sign colour palette. Around here (UK) we have signs in blue, e.g:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RiAxK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With road signs red means stop, take attention, hazard ahead and so forth. Green has its own meanings, however, for bikes that is the colour of a cycle lane, i.e. the tarmac is painted green. I feel we already have a few colours that can be made to work with the design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the heart might work really well if in green. This will mean that the favicon does not look like some dating site or my little pony site. This may appease the naysayers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Randomly thrown in ideas&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am an admire of the cycle artwork that goes with 'Critical Mass' rather than Tour-de-France wannabee-ism, as you get in 'Future Publishing' style magazines. Andy Singer's series was excellent as were Ken Avidor's 'Road Kill Bill' cartoons that could be found in 'Carbusters' magazine a decade ago when it was underground, edgy and subversive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site is also a global affair the sphere-style hills could have some cartoon-ified coastlines that are notionally of continents. We could play with some ideas of scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was impressed by the UK train adverts that Virgin put out a while back. We could do something similar with bicycles going overhead of gridlocked traffic, maybe doing the black and white grey for the cars and true technicolor for the bikes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8deg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/DYqIH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We haven't decided on a strap line, 'It is about the bike!' might work as a working title rather than 'lorem ipsrubbish' that designers pretend to work with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1487" LastActivityDate="2011-07-30T19:48:28.260" CommentCount="4" />

I didn't think a headbadge would work as a logo at first due to the favicon size. But after I played around with the concept more, I think it works with some modification from the bigger version. I believe a headbadge is a more fitting logo. I still left a tiny heart in the logo, to show our love for bicycles, in a more subtle way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also removed the street sign visual treatment for the selected top navigation links in the header.

Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like they're part of the Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Why&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;During the brainstorming phase, I asked myself, why do people ride bicycles if they have a choice of driving a car, or why do they choose cycling if there are other forms of exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was offered a job in a further-away office I thought, &quot;I'm either going to have to move apartments: again. Or, get a faster bike: to go the further distance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I now commute an hour each way, by bike. It's regular exercise, because it's commuting (though I might also do it if I had the leisure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that the motivation, of many &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/3335&quot;&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; at least, is to go fast and far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several categories of biking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Road (racing, training, touring)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Off-road (trails)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hybrid (urban, leisure, utility)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And others: recumbents, children, cargo, trendy bikes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;Bicycles - Stack Exchange is for people who build and repair bicycles, people who train cycling, or commute on bicycles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Myself&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As a one-time bicycle lover myself, I thought about personal freedom, accessibility, low cost and being in touch with the great outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes my first bike was the first time I left my neighbourhood alone, to go exploring. It is relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the outdoors are great (I don't know how people manage 'exercise bikes' and 'trainers' indoors: I get warm and want a fan). Outside there's always as good a breeze as you're willing to cycle into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be, is, easier than walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So for the design, I wanted to capture the feeling of riding a bike, rather than focusing on the bike as an object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feeling of riding a bike&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The feeling of riding a bike, for me, is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brighter than in-doors (or darker at night and winter)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Balance (shoes and pedals)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acceleration (setting off, little effort at low speeds, up-shifting)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gliding (coasting or free-wheeling)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Smooth (cycling feet)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Faster heart and deeper breathing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reality is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20+ mph (32+ kph)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top speed limited by wind resistance: so it's like flying&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;$1500 for a new commuting bike with accessories and free service costs less than the public transit fares for a year&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A year-round commute is feasible: I've easily ridden in -8C through +38C (17F through 100F) temperatures for an hour each way, every weekday (except about 10 days for rain and wind and health) since March 2011, wearing basic cotton clothing and gloves (and sunscreen) etc. Winter is warm, and summer is cool (there's a breeze).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's the practical, commuting 20 km in an hour. One can cross the city about as fast on a bike as by bus and subway and tram/streetcar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a couple of hours of cycling you can burn 1000 calories. Pre-hydrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other people post on the forum about road bikes/races, and about off-road mountain biking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Focusing on the bike as an object&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A major purpose of the site is to Q+A about bikes as objects (here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/18472550&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;interesting advertisement&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tires. Brakes. Gloves. Bearings. Parts. Traffic skills. Maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Art style&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Riding a bicycle is a very personal and independent choice. I wanted the design to reflect that. I believe a hand illustrated art style gives it a more personal touch, and the slightly vintage treatment makes it more timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A poster is better than a photo which could get old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SF is another way to make a timeless treatment (Bruce Sterling's novelette &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Repairman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bicycle Repairman&lt;/a&gt; won the Hugo).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Been around for a long time&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After all, bicycles have been around for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been around, eh? Know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mine's fairly new, and maintained. It's better than my previous one which was new for $130 two years ago (and which is fine for an easy cycle half an hour and back: I lend it for riding to the swimming pool).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bikes people write about are often new or used, and are usually not department store bikes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might find modern bikes surprisingly light and fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Poster&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since the design is entirely focused on a &quot;feeling,&quot; I decided to design a poster for our bicycles site first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nice poster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should see &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311/flyers-for-people-to-use/312#312&quot;&gt;Neil Fein's awesome flyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That way, I didn't have the distraction of the constraints I normally face when creating a design for the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Off-topic do you have a reading list to recommend?

I'm glad to see you've already done that in the current design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above reminds me of Normandy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Above is the poster I came up with. I believe the texture, color scheme and minimalist style work towards the goal I was aiming for. From there I transfered the visual elements onto the site design.&#xA;  Please keep in mind, not all of the site elements are present in these two mockups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ads. And you're showing the header and the footer on the same fold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I incorporated some visuals related to bicycles and cycling, e.g. road signs and cogs. But I was careful to not to make it overly &quot;themey.&quot; Also, I tried to fit all of the design in one image, so it looks busier than the live site will be.&#xA;  I'm pleased with the overall design.

We've actually had enough posts for one a week through another week from now, but we released (published) some very close together (right as soon as they were ready) and never kept any kind of cache of ready posts. There's always going to be some irregularity with when posts are &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes a few in one week, sometimes a dry spell for a couple weeks. Better to make the release schedule more like a smooth one-a-week thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we should keep to a schedule, probably 1 post a week on Mondays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we happen to have an extra post or two in a week, wait to do anything with them. Most posts can sit around a week or three and still be just as relevant. Treat it as a queue and publish the oldest post in the queue sometime on Monday and leave the rest alone. Only jump the queue or release early if there's a timeliness aspect (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2011/08/bicycles-launched/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the launch blog post&lt;/a&gt; or zenbike's &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2011/07/its-tour-time/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tour post&lt;/a&gt;).

This isn't necessarily a bad thing - it means we can give what we want, where we want - though it may limit our budget for near-future initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Location: I'm strongly considering limiting the scope of this contest to &lt;strong&gt;NYC + NJ&lt;/strong&gt; or just the 5 boroughs. This is the first Bicycles.SE contest and I want to make sure it is a success. It will be easier to make it so if I/we focus efforts within a defined area - a city where bike theft is rampant &amp;amp; I can get my hands greasy.

Do cyclists have a use for stickers - maybe something reflective? What would you be inclined to stick on your helmet? What would you want to carry with you on an organized charity ride? What would a shopkeeper be inclined to keep in a stack next to the cash register? Think cheap, eye-catching, useful. Maybe there's something that riders can use in winter?

You need to see if Carlton Reid at BikeBiz can help. Equally, in the U.S. if there is a similar publication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the UK every LBS gets stuff from Madison - the sole UK distributors for Shimano. They can and do get promotional material to their stockists. Also, 'zyro' - sellers of Cateye - have a mini catalog that they get out to the shops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the US there will be a similar wholesaler that bike shops HAVE to deal with, e.g. to get Shimano spares that are not available somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thought, in retail you cannot give potential customers bike catalogues as it is counter productive (they go to a competitor and get a better price). With-hold the catalogue and they are more likely to come back. But, if you work in bicycle sales and strike up a relationship, you want customers to come back to you by name. Therefore, sales staff need a business card rather than a catalogue/brochure to give out to people they make personal sales pitches to. These are generally lacking in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am generally not sure that bike shops are the way to go. I think product managers further up the food chain could do with a place to get common answers to problems with their products sorted, at the bike shop level a customer with a question is a potential sale and pushing them to online 'crowd sourced' help isn't necessarily what you want. Then again, from the perspective of the guy in the shop, if customer comes in and asks for e.g. 'a spare hitch for a Burley XYZ trailer' on a busy Saturday, how does that member of staff find out the part that is needed? Bikes.se could come in handy if e.g. Burley pre-seeded bikes.se with +A pertaining to their products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of cyclists that don't use smartphones, regular phones are what they will have. Hence I think that stickers with the QR code and a short URL are 'needed'. The missing element might be cycling advocacy. If we went in with a cycling advocacy group, e.g. to have a 'Bikes Belong' sticker with 'find me online at bikes.se/zydfa' might be useful for getting stickers to have a message and be useful. If someone didn't want my bike parked on their railings, if some stunning supermodel wanted to ask me out on a date(!) because they liked the cut of my handlebar tape or if I wanted to swap details with someone that I met on the way this could be useful - social networking in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for implementing it technically, I don't think this would be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1487" LastActivityDate="2011-08-26T22:38:02.010" CommentCount="2" />

You haven't specifically limited this to the city that never sleeps, but maybe indicating &quot;if you can get to New York City, you can participate&quot; would be a nice touch.

The turkey of the lock that I owned also got me mad the last time.

If it's a question lacking key details that will likely result in a lot of non-answer answers, I'd like to see us closing quickly to prevent lots of bad answers coming in and try to get the questioner to fix things up so that it's more answerable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0e68b82b2d7a20eba36c9fbe4350dd0d?s=16&amp;amp;d=identicon&amp;amp;r=PG&quot; alt=&quot;freiheit&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/45/freiheit&quot;&gt;freiheit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/2003480#2003480&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; But if it's borderline maybe leave it open.

You can't be too dogmatic - some questions should be closed early - obvious dupes or trolls. Some might need a little work - a little generalisation and less specificity (e.g. the touring ones from the last week or so). But not at all would be the most common situation.

We should use it with a few standard Wordpress features/plugins such as a poll or questionnaire module.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In time we might 'downgrade' the Q+A from being the be-all-and-end-all of the site. Q+A could be how we get new followers, e.g. person with new bike stuck on how to get their gears to work could do a Google search, come to us, find the information they need and then find the wonders of the blog pages/posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an advocacy group there is not a lot of point in them asking just their own members, e.g. if the &lt;em&gt;'Monster Off-Road Penny Farthing Racing Club'&lt;/em&gt; asked their members about whether it was 8'okay to rest a foot on car roofs when stopped at the lights'* then they would get an expected answer/skewed opinion of &lt;em&gt;'yes'&lt;/em&gt;, if they were to ask a wider audience then they would get &lt;em&gt;'no - it gives cycling a bad name'&lt;/em&gt;. Bikes.se would offer them that wider audience of regular cyclists to poll/Q+A. That audience would be arrived at by the Q+A in with diffusion across to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should consider giving advocacy groups 'contributor' access to the blog so that they can put their own stuff up on there - press releases, 'news', 'surveys' and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People crave content, but, for me, most bike websites are not working. It would be really good if the blog had lots and lots of stuff so that it was 'sticky', making you want to come back to it every day. Much like 'Slashdot' for techies. IMHO press releases for new product ranges would be okay too, however it would be good to get the advocacy groups contributing first, and with a passion. Give them the tools - so they can post their own stuff - and they will contribute. Raise hurdles and it won't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the off-season...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the UK the cycling season is May to September. From a retail perspective the tap goes on at the start of May and off at the end of September. Not even Christmas is of any relevance (box shifters took the kids bike market for that away from the local bike shop at or around the time bike shops started focusing on the high end sales and the bike industry does not bring out any 'must have' gifts for the cyclist).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO the best time to do advocacy is during the off season. Too many 'decision making important people' are on holiday during all of August or catching up in September. Catch them on a grey winter's day with attractive ideas about summer cycling and they are more likely to have time for you. Plus, to get anything done in this world, takes time and persistence.

The Stack Exchange system is set up to actively discourage users who don't want to work in the Q&amp;amp;A format, leaving only the ones who will generate good content. These two obviously work at cross purposes, and I don't envy anyone the task of getting new users here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Stack Exchange, good information will be easy to find; as the good answers are upvoted, they'll rise to the top of the page. &lt;strong&gt;Writing good questions and answers is supposed to be a difficult thing, not an easy one.&lt;/strong&gt; New users - and getting them here is the point of this exercise - will see a question like this and assume it's representative of the site.  &lt;strong&gt;Allowing questions that are easy to answer because they're sponsored would be watering down the site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cycle accessory question you link to would almost certainly be closed were it asked today.

That the upvoters agree with the answers? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, introducing a Q&amp;amp;A thread that's easy to participate in would defeat the purpose of the site. We want questions that produce answers by experts. If there are many answers possible, then, a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/glossary&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; community wiki questions to the side, such a question isn't a very good one or it isn't being asked properly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsored questions and conflicts of interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's say that a way can be found to get past all of that. Well and good. If, say, Tektro wanted to sponsor a question about brake levers, would mods be bound to keep it open? What about users who feel that they make horrible components? (Personally, I love my Tektro brakes, but I digress.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would users be bound to avoid &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6286/do-cyclocross-interrupter-touring-brake-levers-reduce-brake-performance/6310#6310&quot;&gt;sharing their extensive knowledge&lt;/a&gt; if it's bad for the sponsor? Are we stuck with a sponsored question if it's a bad question? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how blog functionality was introduced with Blog Overflow, and moderator elections are carried out on a dedicated election page, perhaps a new functionality for contests can be created.

The park websites don't mention this. As primarily a fixed gear cyclist from a large city, I find most of the roads around here unfortunately just to unsafe for a leisurely roll. (Not to say that you cannot get to where you need to go in four lanes of 45mph traffic, but I'd rather die for a reason then just for the hell of it ya'know).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that. A question like &quot;Where can I ride my bike in Brecksvill, OH?&quot; I feel would be to localized to be of much use to many people. However, &quot;What is the cycling situation in the Greater Cleveland area?&quot; (though poorly worded) is a question that could be of relevance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although, &quot;Recommendations for a decent Shop in Brecksville, OH?&quot; (i.e. One that won't rip you off, treat you poorly, or is generally opted by bastards) while rather localized could be of great help to any cyclist, miles from where they started in the metropark system, finding themselves stranded here for whatever reason, thinking their situation dire. One could easily look around and assume that its time to phone a friend and hope for a pickup (or hitchhike).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel that if one, as a cyclist, would read a question and think &lt;em&gt;&quot;Ohmygosh, I would hope to know that were the situation applicable&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, Then it is a question that deserves a chance to be answered with human knowledge. If it is a question that can be answered with a sentence and a link, or 5 seconds on google then I believe that to me a validation that (as your teacher always told you) there are no dumb questions, only dumb people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, although still rather new (and trying the become more involved) to Stack Exchange, I find that the real value here is in the breadth &amp;amp; depth of human knowledge available. Google &amp;amp; such are fantastic tools, but there is simply no substitute for someone who knows what they are talking about. Localized wisdom can be just as valuable as knowledge of a more general sort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2220" LastActivityDate="2011-09-30T01:07:57.480" CommentCount="0" />

It's exactly what the &quot;not constructive&quot; close reason is there for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I'd seen the question before it had any answers, I would've been very likely to intervene (comment suggesting changing to a more concretely answerable question, edit it into one myself). If I'd seen it before there were any answers and it had a couple votes to close and a flag request to close, I would've closed it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the time I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; see the question, it was a day or two after it was originally asked. I briefly contemplated some sort of intervention (closing?), but there were some decent answers. Good answers can save a borderline question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, there were no votes to close the question and no flags on the question. (there were flags on a couple chatty comments that we deleted, though)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, because of the good answers, no votes to close and no flags, I left the question alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If our community wants that question dead, I'd support that. If somebody wants to rewrite the question to be more constructive without invalidating the answers, that would be totally awesome and I would definitely support that if it needed my support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you believe the question should be closed, vote to close it as &quot;not constructive&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2012-01-21T03:45:19.563" CommentCount="0" />

If you've been on any of the &lt;code&gt;.moderated&lt;/code&gt; newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. &lt;em&gt;Anyone&lt;/em&gt; can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question &lt;em&gt;back into review/improve mode&lt;/em&gt;. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we close a question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on &lt;em&gt;problems you face&lt;/em&gt; or things you are trying to understand. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask&quot;&gt;don't ask&lt;/a&gt; section of the FAQ gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some questions belong elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, &lt;em&gt;broadly speaking&lt;/em&gt; true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is closing like deletion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different - they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the requirements for closing a question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have 3000 reputation, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can anyone vote to close/reopen&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is &lt;em&gt;your site&lt;/em&gt;. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are moderators different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, as the reputation requirement rules out many users, you will see moderators doing most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As you gain in reputation, you get to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, so how does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example close button&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Close vote reasons dialog&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&quot; alt=&quot;Other votes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other options are straight out closes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&quot; alt=&quot;Close banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does vote to re-open work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png&quot; alt=&quot;Re-open link&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if I make a mistake?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually there are two tools for this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/a&gt;. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crypto.stackexchange.com/tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/a&gt;. Commonly referred to as the &quot;10k tools&quot;, this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page.

Anyone want to tackle a blog post on bike lanes &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; for wrong-way cycling? (I've been on a few of them.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the answer: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The issue is actually quite complex. Some &quot;wrong-way&quot; routes can be quite safe if well-designed, marked, and implemented. Much of the data and research in this area is in French because &quot;contresens pistes cyclable&quot; have been implemented in several French cities such as Paris, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Lyon, among others. In addition, a few other countries have implemented similar bike ways, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, and the Netherlands. In general, these &quot;counter-direction&quot; bikeways are in dense urban areas with many narrow one-way streets and restricted speed limits (usually, 30 to 40 km/h, or around 20 to 25 mph). A 200 page report from the Institut Federatif de Recherche sur Les Economies et Les Societes Indutrielles (one of the French research institutes) of the experiences in 5 French cities can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fubicy.org/spip.php?article157&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (in French) and a short PowerPoint presentation by the lead author of that study can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fubicy.org/avon/moret/Moret/Contresens%20VaV.ppt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (again, in French). No accidents were observed on contresens bikeways in the study area during the period from 2002-6. A two-page illustrated brochure advocating the expansion of contresens urban pistes can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.droitauvelo.org/DOC/FICHES/fiche1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I was surprised when a contresens piste cyclable was marked on my narow one-way street in Paris. I initially thought it to be suicidal but after riding on it for two blocks I understood why it could be safer: a study of &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; bicycle fatality in Paris in 2005 had shown that the single largest cause of death was being right-hooked at intersections, and the contresens bikeways completely eliminated this danger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:41.050" LastActivityDate="2012-04-17T03:45:32.953" CommentCount="0" />

Adding parenthetical lbs, kg, mi, km, tempF, tempC, etc is a common edit on questions and answers, in order to increase the audience. Many things on our site deal with physical measurement units. Many people only understand one unit system or the other, or simply have a better feel for one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I see a few problems with your plan of dropping that JS in place:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Surprise changes to the text could be confusing and end up with things like &quot;3 miles (4.82 km) (5 km (3.13 miles))&quot;. We want to be very careful with anything that effectively changes the markup (or any behavior) on our site to be different from other sites in the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your script adds significant digits inappropriately. &quot;5 km&quot; should convert to &quot;3 miles&quot; or maybe &quot;3.1&quot; miles, never &quot;3.13&quot; or &quot;3.11&quot;. Adding more than 1 significant digit is just wrong, since it adds implied accuracy. Counting the significant digits of the input and using that many significant digits (or 1 more) on output would be a good start.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Your conversions are wrong. I only checked one, but you have 0.626 as the km to miles conversion, and it should be 0.62137 or 0.621.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Doing it automatically is always going to get it a bit wrong now and then. Some uses of inches and cm (such as heights) should be converted, even though (as you point out) some shouldn't. The difference is in context, not anything a computer will be able to automatically detect reliably. Anything that excludes certain simple units while automatically handling others will confuse people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ways I could see automatic conversion working well:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A feature for assisting people in converting units, and make it available on all SE sites that routinely need such conversions.

However, I don't think that closing and downvoting are inherently unfriendly, and I think the community is accepting of almost any answerable question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think it's hard to talk about this in general, so it's better to raise specific cases where you disagree and when possible to try to edit/improve content. For example, I recently edited the question &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10821/how-does-a-two-wheel-drive-bike-work&quot;&gt;How does a two wheel drive bike work?&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;because I thought it contained the kernel of a great question. I agree with the original closing, though, because it was vague and unanswerable. I think it's worthy of reopening now, but I don't think there was anything wrong with closing it. Looking at other questions that have been closed recently, I really can't argue with most of them. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10870/link-to-a-photo-of-eddy-merckx-seen-from-below-the-bike&quot;&gt;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10870/link-to-a-photo-of-eddy-merckx-seen-from-below-the-bike&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;is searching for a very specific photograph, which is an impossibly specific request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I upvote far more often than I downvote, but I generally downvote any question that seems inherently unanswerable, chatty (&quot;What is your favorite...?&quot;), or requests recommendation of a specific model or brand of something (answers to such questions expire almost instantly). In general, I think that I and others on the site tend to be pretty accepting of questions that are more subjective than other Stack Exchange Sites. The only major area where I seem to disagree with others is that I think that medical and especially first aid questions should be considered on-topic. When people downvote answers, they may either think that the answer is wrong or that it's not really an answer or would be more appropriate as a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you have specific questions where you disagree with everyone else?

(Since you're not citing specific examples, I'm answering this in a broad, general way. If I'm covering stuff you're very familiar with, I apologize if it comes across as lecturing or talking down; that's not my intent.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange sites are not web forums, whose job is to encourage a happy community that will come back and keep the site running through ad impressions. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's true. The purpose of a Stack Exchange Q&amp;amp;A site is not to provide a forum for people's questions, or even to help people. The purpose of Stack Exchange is to make the internet a better, more curated place, with lists of on-topic questions where the community votes the best answers to the top of the page. We want to ask and answer questions so well that when you Google &quot;How do I fix [problem] on my [type of bike]&quot;, that Stack Exchange question is the first hit on Google. Furthermore, we want to be viewed as a &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; resource. (That last is very important.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Communities are provided with the &lt;strong&gt;close and delete mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that questions that are off-topic, or unanswerable (i.e., can't be answered definitively and voted on) will be removed from the site. Closing a question disallows further answers, so the question can be edited. If the question is beyond saving, it can be deleted. Of course, individuals will disagree on what questions are good ones. This helps make the question more reliably answerable with answers that can be voted on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing is not unfriendly, nor is it malicious. Think of editing a letter: Would you want to edit a letter as the replies came in? Of course not, you'd want to edit it before it's sent out. Similarly, it's worth noting that, when borderline or problematic questions are closed &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;, they can be edited with a freer hand than if they're left open. If they're left open, answers pile up, then it makes it harder to edit the question into a good one. &quot;What bike should I get&quot; may be edited to &quot;What features should I get in a winter commuter bike&quot;. If the more general question is answered, it's a waste of everybody's time.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to encourage good content and discourage bad content, users are also provided with the &lt;strong&gt;upvote and downvote mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. Upvoting good content is a way of telling the system, &quot;this person does good stuff here. We can trust them.&quot; Similarly, misinformation needs to be voted down, or the site will fill with it over time. Downvoting is a deterrent that needs to be exercised or Stack Exchange won't work. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to the meat of this: Leaving feedback when downvoting is undeniably helpful. Downvoting someone's question or answer without explaining why leaves them to guess at why they were downvoted. It feels like a slap, getting a downvote like that. Requiring users to leave a comment while downvoting has been discussed on Meta.SO. However, filling out a comment to fill out a comment seems pointless, and it's important to preserve &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/27534/see-who-is-upvoting-downvoting-my-question-answer&quot;&gt;voter anonymity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as most users are leaving constructive feedback, I think we'll be fine. Drive-by downvoting is, as far as I can see, the exception and not the rule.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the downvoting and enforcement is just the random acts of trolls...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's easy to feel this way when you see a question closed. And I would agree that responsible downvoting and closing should be accompanied with comments explaining how the question can be improved, or it's worthless. (However, I also feel that anonymous downvoting is desirable. But that's another discussion.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you feel that &quot;enforcing&quot; is a bad thing, perhaps Stack Exchange isn't for you. This is not a feee-for-all discussion forum, it's a place meant to generate good, worthwhile, structured content that will improve the internet. People who downvote and close questions are absolutely required, and calling them &quot;trolls&quot; dismisses their contributions to the site. They are encouraging good content by taking these actions. Rather than worry about the few anonymous downvoters, simply encourage constructive feeback by listening and responding to it. And viewing closing as an opportunity to edit and re-open will result in better questions and answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:37.690" LastActivityDate="2012-08-21T20:16:39.073" CommentCount="1" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful biking resources and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

To sum up, the OP caught a girl in the act of stealing his bike, stopped her, and got his bike back. His question is whether or not he should press charges. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is whether or not this is really on topic. It seems to me that the fact that what she was stealing was a bike is irrelevant. If she were attempting to steal a purse, briefcase, or whatever, it wouldn't change the nature of the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that view, I was surprised to see that the question had received half a dozen upvotes and quite a few answers with even more upvotes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what does everyone else think?

I think questions about bike theft - and theft prevention - are firmly on-topic, and I'll explain why: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a bike stolen isn't like having a purse or a briefcase, since purses and briefcases aren't vehicles. But I understand your point, and a more accurate comparison would be automobile theft. Having a bike stolen isn't anything like having a car stolen, since the police in many areas don't have the time to deal with bike thieves. The decision about whether to press charges and involve insurance companies is generally only a decision when bikes are involved; auto theft generally involves these entities by default. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the methods of preventing bike theft aren't anything like securing a car. You need to tote a lock with you and find a good place to lock up. There's the sliding scale of a heavy lock and high security versus the convenience of a light but less-secure lock. And, of course, you can sidestep this by getting a folding bike and carrying it with you. Quick-release wheels make theft easier, but maintenance more difficult. And so on. Few of these really have close analogies to any other kind of theft prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if the community decides these questions are off-topic, where will these questions be asked? Turning these questions away is, essentially, turning them away from the entire Stack Exchange network. Possibly other sites could address the issues involved, but probably not as well. I'd like to see these questions answered by the experts on this site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since bike theft is a reasonably unique kind of theft, I'd like to see it remain on-topic here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastEditorUserId="8" LastEditDate="2013-02-05T02:04:05.533" LastActivityDate="2013-02-05T02:04:05.533" CommentCount="5" />

A lot of companies do bike to work month contests to see who can bike the farthest (or most days) each week and during the whole month. If we could implement some sort of miles/trips tracker, we could have a prize for most miles biked and most days biked during bike to work month. The winner could get a little swag package with the Bikes.SE shirt, bottle, and stickers, and perhaps a nicer additional prize like a light. This part of the contest doesn't directly improve content on the site, but I believe it benefits promotion in a couple of ways: it gets people thinking about the site, coworkers and friends may find out about the site from seeing the contest participants getting buff, etc. Also, we like fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We could do a &lt;strong&gt;participation or tasks&lt;/strong&gt; aspect to the contest, like what we had on Super User for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://win8challenge.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Windows 8 Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of that, if flag reasons are wrong, the flag may get declined, even if there's something else wrong with the post. It's helpful to pick the right flag reasons, and to use the custom text when none of the reasons is right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators (on a non-beta SE site) are here to enforce the clear community consensus. Because of that, if a post is borderline, there are no close votes and there is only one flag, we may decide not to do anything (though in that case we should mark the flag as helpful). We may simply let the flag sit for a bit to give other users a chance to vote to close or flag the post. It's better if a post is closed by several users instead of just one moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have the rep to close vote, you should do that on posts you think should be closed. Some mods will even decline a flag asking for a close if the flagger has the rep to close vote and didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Specifics of this post:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That post is about the laws around bicycling. Specifically, about a detail of the legal status of bicycles on the road. We've &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/755/are-law-questions-ok&quot;&gt;decided that bicycling legal questions are on topic&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore this question is clearly on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your point about practical, answerable questions would be a &lt;em&gt;not constructive&lt;/em&gt; close reason, not an &lt;em&gt;off topic&lt;/em&gt; close reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That question doesn't appear to be &lt;em&gt;not constructive&lt;/em&gt; to me, either. The only flaw I see is that it would be better scoped to a reasonable legal jurisdiction (country or state/province in a country), since laws are very different between countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's definitely an &lt;em&gt;answerable&lt;/em&gt; question. Either quoting the relevant laws, giving reasons for why the laws are written that way, or talking about the history behind those laws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not immediately obvious what the &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; use is, but it's easy enough to imagine many. Understanding what the bicycling laws are and why they are that way can influence specific riding behavior, and is important background for anybody involved in bicycling advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:19:25.967" LastActivityDate="2013-04-04T21:19:01.883" CommentCount="0" />

This is fairly common when comparing similar quality bikes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, comparing one company's components to similar quality components from another company is not as straight forward as &quot;this one is better than that one.&quot; Usually, it's more along the lines of &quot;this is nice about this one, but this other thing is nice about this other one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as how well a question like this fits into the site...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you just want to compare the two groupsets on the bikes you've shortlisted, it's probably too localized. Those two bikes will probably each change a component or two when next year's product line rolls out and the question will no longer be valid. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, there's a lot of subjectivity in comparing one brand to another. There's a lot of brand loyalty regarding bike components. Sometimes that brand loyalty is well warranted and reasonable, other times it seems to come from a more emotional place. The truth is that most companies make good parts and crappy parts and everything in between. But you still find people who say that company x is awesome and company y sucks.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bontrager is a subsidiary of Trek. They mostly make static parts with no moving parts like seatposts and stems. Shimano is an independent company that makes fishing and rowing equipment as well as bike parts. They basically specialize in small parts with a lot of moving pieces. Their bike line consists of mostly drivetrain components. There's not a whole lot of overlap between the two, wheels being the big exception. And I don't see any overlap on the two bikes you're comparing so I'm not even sure what you're wanting to compare. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of that being said, I think that there's probably a way to ask about comparing components in a general way that would both help future visitors and get the information you need to make an informed purchase. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4239" LastEditorUserId="4239" LastEditDate="2013-06-01T16:17:16.477" LastActivityDate="2013-06-01T16:17:16.477" CommentCount="0" />

From your bio, it looks like you've done a good amount of cycling, and almost certainly would have something to contribute.

It's related to bicycles, but simple.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful biking resources and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

For example, there is an objectively correct answer to &quot;What should I look for in a bike for road racing?&quot; but there is no objectively correct answer to &quot;Which road bike is better?&quot; See &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/do-we-go-shopping&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; for more info about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw in the comments that you mentioned the product-rec tag. It's really only been in the past year or so that the community has really become fully aware of just how problematic shopping questions are, which is why you'll see a number of open questions with the product-rec tag. Many Stack Exchange sites ban them outright. There has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/828/adding-shopping-recommendations-to-the-vote-to-close-page&quot;&gt;some discussion&lt;/a&gt; about doing that here, but it hasn't actually happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4239" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:19:25.967" LastActivityDate="2014-03-04T20:33:05.780" CommentCount="3" />

The first step is to ping the mod in the private site mod chatroom, and get clarification. 99% of the time that resolves it &amp;ndash; usually one or the other mod either misread the post or had a different interpretation; once you see eye to eye it's easy to make a decision. If there's still disagreement, I ping the other mods on the site to get a variety of opinions, and a decision is made on consensus. This hardly ever happens though; talking to the mod who took the action almost always resolves the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most important thing is to never drag it out in public. Moderators have their own styles, but shouldn't second-guess each other in public. Never get the author of the post involved; it's not their fault if moderators disagree, and provides unwanted fodder for unproductive conversations like &quot;well the mods can't even decide what's on topic, so why should my post be closed!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the&#xA;  biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to&#xA;  get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these&#xA;  issues?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest issue is increasing participation. This site is a great resource, and there are some very knowledgeable participants, but it can be kind of slow sometimes. Only the first page of users can even vote to close questions, and fewer than two pages of users can edit freely. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging more voting is important, but it's also necessary to bring in new traffic. I've been very active in promoting the site already:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In person, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.blogoverflow.com/2013/05/sunday-parkways-recap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange booth at Portland Sunday Parkways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the Bikes.SE blog. My bike light reviews have brought in hundreds of thousands of visitors, and some of whom follow through to visit the main site and even become active users. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On other sites. I mention a few of my favorite Bikes.SE questions frequently when they're relevant in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/r/bicycling&lt;/a&gt; threads on reddit, and I promote asking questions on Bike.SE from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikelightdatabase.com/faq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;FAQ on my Bike Lights Database site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a moderator I will continue these activities to increase participation. I also have experience working with Stack Exchange's marketing team and community managers to organize promotional events, both online and in the physical world. I will build on these relationships to make the community's ideas for promotion come true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of&#xA;  valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of&#xA;  arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I've had to deal with this several times as a Super User moderator. &lt;strong&gt;The following is all from actual interactions with actual users, not hypothetical.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key is to be polite, but firm, and to not make a public spectacle. The first step is a private mod message, emphasizing the value of their contributions, but warning them of Stack Exchange's behavior policies. In some cases the user doesn't realize they're causing a problem, and adjusts their behavior. In others, the user escalates the situation in a variety of ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to use private mod messages judiciously, and not enter into an argument. Sticking to objective facts and specific behavior that needs to change, rather than attacking the individual, is key. I generally limit myself to 2 replies asking for &quot;clarification&quot; or redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the user's behavior still hasn't improved, I next discuss with the other moderators. Especially with &quot;high profile&quot; users it's important to be on the same page and have a unified plan for resolution. Sometimes a more sternly worded mod message from a second moderator emphasizes that the issue is breaking the &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;'s policies, and they're not being picked on by a single &quot;rogue moderator&quot; (their words, not mine!). If that still doesn't work, a brief suspension can be carefully considered, but does have the potential to backfire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the very worst case scenario, a user has quit the site completely after deciding they were unable to align with the community's standards. While this is a very disappointing outcome when it happens (which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rarely), &lt;strong&gt;the integrity of the community cannot be sacrificed for the answers of one user&lt;/strong&gt;. While I always pursue all possibilities to retain a user with valuable answers and contentious comments, the overall health of the community is paramount, and I'm not afraid to let a user go if it becomes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc&#xA;  a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marked as duplicate by nhinkle♦&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;This question has been asked before and already has an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, it's mostly maintenance. Handling flags, keeping an eye on the review queue, destroying spam, etc. It's also caring for the overall health and direction of the site: answering questions on meta, organizing community promotions, and keeping abreast of new developments with the Stack Exchange platform and network-wide policies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other important thing moderators do is serve as a role model: welcoming new users by editing their posts and showing them the ropes, being courteous in comments, and advocating on behalf of the users when inter-site issues occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the&#xA;  past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will&#xA;  do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have many questions and answers to begin with, because I'm not the foremost expert on bike questions. I just love bikes, and I love Stack Exchange. For the questions, answers, and comments I do have, it won't make much a difference. My posts are already professional. The only difference will be carrying more authority when making comments critiquing other users, but again, I have plenty of experience with doing this tactfully and writing appropriately with a diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everybody claims that after they become a moderator they'll do the same thing they did before, just help out more with the stuff they didn't have access to. It's not entirely true &amp;ndash; I've seen it happen in dozens of moderators. You're always checking the queue and keeping an eye out for posts with problems, and it leaves less time to ask and answer. Fortunately, because I already ask and answer infrequently, you wouldn't be losing post-writing time by electing me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more&#xA;  effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering there are only 6 users with &gt;10k and only one with &gt;20k, this question is a bit of a moot point for this election. I won't get to 10k on Bikes.SE any time soon, if ever, so being a moderator would make me immensely more effective. Moderation is perhaps the most effective way I can support this community, because I'm not equipped with the knowledge to answer most of the questions that come through. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a small site like this, there also benefits to the unilateral abilities of a moderator. It can take quite a while to accumulate 5 close votes, but a moderator can close a question immediately. Moderators also have access to more nuanced tools like mod messages, suspensions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's your take on link-only answers that get flagged for not being&#xA;  answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth&#xA;  keeping around if they answer the question? See also: Avoiding 'Just&#xA;  Buy A New One' or 'Here's A Link' Answers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Comment, asking them to expand their answer. Step 2: If they did, great, upvotes! If they didn't... Step 3: If the content behind the link could form the basis for a truly good answer that's currently not posted on the question, edit the answer into a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; answer with the link as a reference. Then comment and let the user know, &quot;this is how you can turn a link into a good answer. Now you know how, and can do that yourself in the future&quot;. Teach a person to fish. Step 3, alternate: If the content is crap, delete the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just buy a new one&quot; is kind of nuanced... if your bike got run over by a semi truck, then it's probably a valid answer (although the question, &quot;how can I fix my bike&quot; might not be valid). In general though, I don't think &quot;just buy a new one&quot; is a useful response, and I would lean towards deleting it unless the answer provides other useful insights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If&#xA;  so, what would you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not really. There are currently 65/4203 questions unanswered. That's 1.5%; not too shabby. More answers would be great, but there's not a &lt;em&gt;whole lot&lt;/em&gt; moderators can do about that, besides trying to recruit more members, which I've discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2014-03-12T23:08:52.577" LastActivityDate="2014-03-12T23:08:52.577" CommentCount="1" />

I won't bother with making excuses, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would first contact the other moderator to find out their opinion on the matter and, conversely, express mine. Hopefully, that would clear up the issue and we could agree on whether to retract the original decision or leave it in place. If not, we would naturally bring in the other moderators and hopefully reach a consensus. Barring a consensus, my thought would be to leave the question open (regardless of whether I wanted it closed or open) so that the community could then vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;a) What is, in your opinion as a potential future moderator, the biggest problem that bicycles.SE currently faces? b) If you were to get elected, what actions would you take towards resolving these issues?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think our biggest problem right now is similar to what nhinkle said: too few members. However, I have a different take on that problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, because of our relatively small numbers, we have a problem reaching a consensus on issues relevant to the future of the site, and even when we do reach a consensus, we have a problem enforcing it. For example, we've reached a consensus on what type of shopping questions we allow, but we regularly see shopping questions that don't fit our criteria sit open because we don't have enough people voting to close them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't have the insider track that Nathan has, so I'm not sure if this is within the realm of power that a mod has, but I'd like to see either the vote thresholds lowered for smaller SE sites like ours, or the length of time that a vote remains active made longer. Lowering the threshold would be my preference between the two. I think three votes represents a consensus  for our community. And if that's too aggressive for a question or two once in a while, we can always vote to reopen. I've actually had to do that with a question I posted on AskUbuntu and it's a relatively painless process. (Incidentally, that question has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://askubuntu.com/questions/194651/why-use-apt-get-upgrade-instead-of-apt-get-dist-upgrade&quot;&gt;super popular&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would first make the assumption that the user wasn't being intentionally argumentative/hostile/rude/whatever the problem is and that it was all unintentional. Under that assumption, I would contact the user and let them know that we had received a number of flags and illustrate that the perceived problems with his/her posts. I think that with most users, this would solve the problem. If it did not solve the problem, I would ask the other mods for their opinions on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Delete spam. Delete lots and lots of spam. Seriously though...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of what they do, as I understand it, is getting rid of stuff that obviously doesn't fit the site, obviously off-topic questions, &quot;I'm having this problem too&quot; type answers that don't actually provide an answer, etc. They also handle the problems that users with less rep (less than 10k) bring to their attention, i.e., flags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I really can't say it better than &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;A Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;: Moderators are human exception handlers.&quot; 99% of the time, the site chugs along under its own steam and the community takes care of problems. Every once in a while, something weird pops up that is so borderline that the community can't come to a consensus. This is when the moderators would have to step in (as a group, of course) and make a decision. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm fine with that. I make a conscious effort to be civil and polite in my writing style. I'm aware that my posts will be seen as more authoritative with the moderator diamond next to them, and I'm sure I've made mistakes in the past, but I also make a conscious effort to admit when I'm wrong (in life, as well as on this site), which I think would alleviate any of those errors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the right thing to say when I'm running for a moderator position, but I think I would actually be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; effective as a mod than I would as a regular user with 10k+ rep. As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/election/2#post-20533&quot;&gt;nomination&lt;/a&gt;, I'm the most active reviewer on the site. I review with reckless abandon right now, comfortable in the knowledge that all of my decisions will be checked and double checked by other users and are ultimately just a drop in the bucket of community consensus. I will have to tone myself back some as a mod, leaving fringe cases open to the community. And as I mentioned above, this means that some edge cases that the community probably, but not obviously, wants closed could remain open. Soooo...yeah. Don't...vote...for...me? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But seriously, do. And then hit the review queue hard if you have the rep. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's your take on &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/tags/link-only-answers/info&quot;&gt;link-only answers&lt;/a&gt; that get flagged for not being answers? Should they be removed when flagged, or are they worth keeping around if they answer the question?

Preferably, someone would comment and the person who posted it would do it. Barring that, I would hope that a community member would do it. I realize that's not necessarily realistic. I would still tend to think that as long as it offers something valuable, it should be left up. If the link dies, then it's time to take it down. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think bicycles has too many unanswered questions? Why not? If so, what would you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nope. As nhinkle mentioned, only 1.5% of our questions are &quot;unanswered.&quot; I put that in quotes, because only 1% are actually without answers, the other 0.5% have answers without votes. Compared to a lot of SE sites (including the big dogs like Stack Overflow) that have 15-30% unanswered questions, a 99% answer rate is pretty darn good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4239" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:41.050" LastActivityDate="2014-03-12T23:49:11.707" CommentCount="0" />

One thing that makes the site easier to use and easier to search is when words are spelled correctly and grammar is reasonable. If someone wants to spend time working on that good on them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reputation harvesting this way is very tedious but for a complete newbie it's one of the few ways to get through the low-rep irritations (other than by asking questions that are just barely useful enough not to get deleted). I've seen quite a few users doing this and I'm mostly annoyed because it takes time to make sure they're not half-fixes - I have to proof-read the whole thing (to make sure that there are not other spelling/grammar problems). Where those exist, BTW, I will reject their edit and make my own. But that's rare, and usually only seen with users who search for common misspellings and fix only their search hits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(edit) I regularly approve edits that are just spelling or wording, and I find I form a positive opinion of the users who do the edits. It's not fun work but it is useful and at times essential. Unfortunately that opinion-forming carries over to users whose material regularly needs work - I find myself biased against them because they're lazy and/or stupid. More importantly, if I can't understand an answer because it's so badly formatted or worded, what's the point it having it on the site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if they use their newly-minted reputation to do stupid stuff they'll get downvoted or banned and the problem will have self-corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7044" LastEditorUserId="7044" LastEditDate="2014-06-25T01:02:12.960" LastActivityDate="2014-06-25T01:02:12.960" CommentCount="6" />

Everyone's answer would be equally valid. (&quot;Equally valid&quot; used to be the actual phrasing of the too broad closure.) It's kind of like asking what the name for a dark brown, sweet, carbonated beverage is. Some people call it &quot;soda,&quot; others &quot;pop,&quot; in the US South it's often referred to as a &quot;Coke&quot; regardless of the actual brand, and still other people might refer to it as a &quot;sodie pop.&quot; None of these is wrong and if each were a separate answer it would be impossible to upvote and accept one of them as correct, which is the ultimate goal of the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never changed it from &quot;primarily opinion-based&quot; to &quot;too broad&quot; for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I didn't want to step on Gary.Ray's toes. And, more importantly,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By the time I would have done so, it already had a reopen vote. If I had changed it, I would have had to reopen it and then close it again, thus invalidating the reopen vote.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, it seems that the community has opted to reopen it. However, As noted in the blog post that I mentioned earlier, whether or not a question becomes a poll is often a function of the answers more than the question itself. If the question &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; end up becoming a poll, I would feel inclined to revisit the issue of closing it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also like to mention that moderators are volunteers. We review questions that come to our attention and often learn as we go. Some of those questions you mention are older questions, when Stack Exchange was young, Bicycles SE was even younger, and all the moderators were fresh-faced recruits. Some of them should probably be looked at again and possibly closed or locked. Others were borderline and the answers never pushed it over the line. Sometimes we're in a hurry and might not give a question its due regard. Sometimes we're having a bad day and that might lend itself to a sterner hand. In short, we're only human. We do what we can and sometimes that results in inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, you can always help us with inconsistencies by flagging any questions that you think don't fit the site. We look at flagged questions much more closely than random questions that pop up on the site throughout any given day. And once you hit 3000 rep, you can vote to close those questions. Ultimately, we would all prefer that questions get closed by community vote rather than by moderator intervention. We just don't have enough high rep users yet for that to always work well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4239" LastActivityDate="2014-08-01T13:57:10.850" CommentCount="4" />

The bike must be well-fitted to you, and is often custom built. It will have narrow wheels and tires, drop handlebars, a high seat, &quot;clipless&quot; pedals, and no mudguards / fenders. Often used for commuting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Road - commuting&lt;/strong&gt; Used for sport, commuting, recreation. The bike needs to be a good size for you. It may have a variety of features: flat handlebars or drop bars, mudguards / fenders, pannier fixing points, pack rack(s). It could have tires 23mm wide, 25mm wide (commonly), or 28mm up to about 32mm. It must have good lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Road - touring&lt;/strong&gt; Used for longer rides while carrying loads. Can be used for commuting and general recreation. Such a bike must be a good fit for you. It will have mudguards / fenders, stronger wheels, mounting points for panniers, a pack rack, lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many categories do we want? Hybrid, General recreation, Carrying / towing kids, MTB, Downhill, Trails, ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few ideas on the kind of features to be mentioned ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handlebars&lt;/strong&gt; The choices are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat bars&lt;/strong&gt; Many commuters use bikes with flat handlebars. A bike built to have flat handle bars will generally feel more relaxed to ride and be more stable.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Advantages: More relaxed upright riding position, can see more of the scenery, ...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Disadvantages: Only one riding position can be tiring if you ride far or try to go faster, ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop bars&lt;/strong&gt; More athletic commuters use bikes with drop bars (like on a racing bike). A bike built to have drop bars will generally be more sensitive to small movements and feel less stable.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Advantages: Five or six different hand positions allow different riding positions and improve comfort when riding further and in varying conditions, the lower body position means you can ride faster for the same effort, ...&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Disadvantages: More stress on your body - especially your back and neck, hands can sometimes be away from the brake levers, can be harder to look behind to see traffic, ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheel sizes&lt;/strong&gt; See also &lt;strong&gt;Tire width&lt;/strong&gt;. The diameter choices are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;700c&lt;/strong&gt; This is a world-wide standard, common &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everywhere. Check that your Local Shop stocks tires and tubes in this size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;???&lt;/strong&gt; [mention MTB sizes?]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tire width&lt;/strong&gt; On rougher roads you'll be more comfortable on wider tires. The bike frame and wheel rims must be able to accommodate the tire width. A few choices are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20mm&lt;/strong&gt; Suitable only for good roads and a &quot;racing&quot; bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23mm&lt;/strong&gt; A fairly narrow general use width, more suited to good roads and faster riding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25mm&lt;/strong&gt; A good general use size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28mm&lt;/strong&gt; A wider tire for rough roads and slower riding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tires come in widths up to 45mm. Wider tires require wider rims and larger frames. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phew!

The consensus there is that what is really needed is a canonical answer. Webmasters SE provides a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;good examples&lt;/a&gt; of how to implement this. I think the best way for us to do this would be a single question that covers an overview on choosing a bike (e.g., fit, benefits of old vs. new, etc.), how to choose between different styles of bikes (e.g., CX, XC, road), and then how to choose within each classification. It would be a monstrous answer for sure, but I think it would be a better catch-all than individual questions since newbies are often asking all of those questions bundled together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drivetrain compatibility question is significantly thornier. I like the idea overall since it would be nice not to have a thousand different compatibility questions, but I think it would be too unwieldy to be realistically attainable. Even if we confined it to the more common brands (Shimano, Sram, Campy, Suntour, etc.) you practically need a flowchart to keep it all straight between companies, number of gears, road vs. mountain, etc. Throw in the odd balls (Rohloff, Sturmey-Archer, NuVinci) and it gets really hairy. And what happens when technology progresses? Electronic shifting and belt drives are sure to offer potential new realms of compatibility issues. There are rumors floating around that 12 speed drive trains in the works. And then there's the question of what to do about combos that work, but sub-optimally?

People &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; search the site and mark duplicates if they wanted to, but that seems like boring menial labor to me. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing to do would be to have a community wiki of commonly asked questions and just lump all the answers in there. Other sites have this as a &quot;big-list&quot; type tagged question, but it might be somewhat useful here. Then again, someone would need to check the big list, unless it comes up for them somehow. But then again, if most people searched their problems on the Park Tool repair site or Sheldon Brown, chances are they wouldn't have anything to post about anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to note is that Bicycles.SE does not attract a lot of repeat question-ers.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful biking resources and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

This results in them floating to the front page periodically, even though there is an answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This should (hopefully) make a few more questions have accepted answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be better if we did encourage people to write answers rather than just comments though (I do know I sometimes answer a question in comments as do some others).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8219" LastActivityDate="2015-06-27T01:20:26.553" CommentCount="1" />

On the main stack, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, most questions get a (fairly definitive) answer within &lt;em&gt;minutes&lt;/em&gt;, and are also quickly pushed of the front page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I observe an approach of &lt;em&gt;well since nobody else has answered, I'll have a go&lt;/em&gt;. Any answer, or a partial answer, being better than none. Often this has the effect of triggering other answers in response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a short answer that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have been a comment is all that is required; one or two of your own answers are in this category. But longer more thorough answers almost always attract more votes. But because of the small user base, no answer has ever achieved &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/help/badges/40/great-answer&quot;&gt;Great Answer&lt;/a&gt; status. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The voting patterns are interesting (to me, at least). Question pages with 50 or so views commonly get 4 or so votes, spread between the question and the answers. But pages with thousands of views tend to get far lower voting rates per view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, on the one hand, the early voting tends to be quite generous, encouraging people who answer. But the later voting suggests something like &lt;em&gt;meh, (s)he's got enough votes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the view of generous voting is also supported by the culture that we have very few downvotes, preferring to upvote other answers or leaving a comment. Looking at the voting figures for the top 50 users shows a downvote rate of about 1% or 2% of the upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mouse-over for the vote buttons says&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This answer is useful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This answer is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They don't say &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think we tend to upvote answers that are &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;, and downvote answers that are seen as wrong, rude/abusive or even dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer the question - I think it's due to the small size of the user base.

All sort of scenarios could have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practices I've observed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On other stacks, it's common for a user to integrate comments below their own post into it. It happens less often here. The post author usually comments along the lines of &lt;em&gt;thanks, I'll add that in&lt;/em&gt;, or just adds the idea / clarification / change and either gives credit in the post or in the edit comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think the main thing is to give credit. If you give a link that's better, because people can follow it to vote up the work you reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few of my own examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/31494/best-ways-to-avoid-getting-hit-by-cars/31496#31496&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example where I've incorporated a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/32170/how-to-improve-ones-bike-handling-skills/32173#32173&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a case where someone else's answer inspired a change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/31063/what-is-the-best-way-to-approach-train-tracks/31079#31079&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a case where I link to another comment by Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main thing is to behave with respect to our fellow community members. Treat others as you would want to be treated. But also, we should police our own community, using our votes to show approval or otherwise of other's behavior. If you can do it politely, you can also leave comments.

There's not much difference, except late answers are always ... answers, and there seems to be a higher chance of spam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a wiki post, consider it as a draft and feel free edit at will. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The options you have are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upvote and approve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I've been doing this more often, lately. It's a way of showing the user they're on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downvote and approve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don't do this ever. Would others like to comment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Do this if you're not sure what to do with it. If you want to see what others do, you can open the post (the question title links to the question) and star it (make it a favorite). Come back to it in a day or so to see that happened. You can also click the &quot;history&quot; link to see &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to skip it is if you think you're not being impartial. This happens to me (andy256) sometimes when I've already answered a question and then find it on the review queue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approve without comment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Often other users have already posted comments or answers by the time you see the post on the queue. If any concerns have already been addressed then it makes sense to just approve it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;On the other hand, some new users just seem to get it. So much so that a nice encouraging welcome message seems out of place. If you're not leaving a nice message, consider an up vote. I (andy256) have done this more often, lately.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;New users with 101 rep have come from another site, so they often don't need guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag the post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;After clicking &lt;em&gt;Flag&lt;/em&gt; you get several options. In my understanding, most of them lead to the post getting onto other review queues, or to a queue for moderator attention. Flag the post when you think there's something wrong with it. Sometimes it seems worthwhile to leave a comment explaining that you're flagging the post and what the user could do about it, but only do this if the post seems salvageable. If not then don't try to discuss it with the poster, just flag it and let others deal with it. Some flag actions seem to automatically create a downvote (spam questions, for example - keep flagging them, after 6 flags they get deleted).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When a post should have been a comment (the newbie doesn't have enough rep to post comments) you can flag for moderator attention, and politely ask them to convert it to a comment. Leave a comment for the user to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approve with a comment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you include [Bicycles.SE] in your comment it gets converted to link to the site. I like to add @username (I learned it on [English.se]) because it gives an example of how to address a user in comments (it has no effect in this case, but it is an example).

Then I couldn't help myself and added an unhelpful comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A better approach might have been to edit the question, removing all parenting references, and leaving a question that just compared DH skiing and biking.

The pricing answer is either &quot;it's worth what you're willing to pay&quot; or &quot;a magic oracle says it's worth two fish and a turnip&quot;, and we can't give a generic factual answer either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it's useful to have a vague idea of the second hand value, the new value plus looking at reviews is usually a better guide. Second hand sales are affected by so many factors that past sales are a poor guide. Pulling those apart to decide whether each sale was a stolen bike, a trashed bike, a bike with hidden damage or a desperate seller is usually impossible. Deciding instead to use a &quot;blue book&quot; is purely an argument from authority and invalid for all the usual reasons. Plus expressing an opinion about pricing is only meaningful when it's an observation of the interaction between a willing seller and willing buyer... exactly what the argument from authority is trying to avoid. Will the &quot;blue book&quot; people either buy or sell at the price they give? No. The end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trouble with &quot;benefit from current answers about specific items&quot; is that those answers will inevitably be local in both space and time.

If its non-trivial to find the answer with a quick web search, and others can objectively use the result, I wont't vote to close. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, there was a question on mounting V-brakes and I specifically mentioned a Mavic product, and there are maybe 2 products on the market which do that functionality. I think it was a good question that does have some aspect of product rec to it, but I don't think it should be closed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example, if you want to replace a rear derailleur and its a 10 speed road Shimano system, you can put in a certain set of Shimano RD's (or Microshift as well, technically, though nobody does).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, some parts tend to be relatively specialized, e.g. in the lights question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally draw the line depending on the broadness and repeated utility. If its something super wide (e.g. is this bike good, find me a hybrid i'm 5'11&quot;, etc.), I'll vote to close because its a pretty opinion based question which you can get a million answers and doesn't help anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with the lights question, its quite niche, theres a few specialized answers and if someone else has that problem, its great for them to look it up there.

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful biking resources and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be &lt;strong&gt;300 x 250 pixels&lt;/strong&gt;, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of &lt;strong&gt;150 KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px (2px if high DPI) border surrounding it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1090&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2026" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:37.690" LastActivityDate="2016-02-11T01:16:39.393" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2016" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="6" CommentCount="5" FavoriteCount="2" />

Rather, you should use 9 speed for a 2 x 9 or 6 speed for a 3 x 6.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that component compatibility is often based off of the thickness of the rear cogs and the spacing between them.

That way, people can understand what the site is simply by seeing the icon.  It will help people to recognize the site when all they see is an icon.  People seeing just an icon is something that does actually happen, in the multi-site &quot;Hot Network Questions&quot; panel.  It may allow people to skip a question if they really aren't interested in reading about bicycles right now, and it may attract people who might be more prone to skip a question just because they really aren't interested in reading about grey boxes with green hearts right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24780" LastEditorUserId="24780" LastEditDate="2016-06-02T12:43:58.663" LastActivityDate="2016-06-02T12:43:58.663" CommentCount="8" />

You'll note that even this wildly incorrect answer that disagreed with every other answer still took days to get even one downvote, and is on -3 right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps not the ideal example, because Bicycles.SE is a site where safety questions do come up.

Rather than realizing that, the OP is trying to use instantaneous speed as a proxy. Looked at factors influencing instantaneous speed as being &quot;random&quot; and therefore their realized speed as a random variable drawn from a distribution of possible values, where the central tendency of the distribution represents some theoretical such as  OP's instantaneous speed in a vacuum on flat land. The OP, then went about trying to estimate this using different ways to sample instantaneous speed, then fit it distribution to it (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I think this question should have been flagged as unclear what you're asking, and closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If my interpretation is remotely correct then the original question is not clearly worded and Andy's original proposal (&lt;strong&gt;closing as unclear&lt;/strong&gt;) would be the logical action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So the question is - what to do.

I also think the OP is conflating (or not distinguishing) between process (i.e., riding a dirty bike one day or riding up mostly hills another day) and observation error (e.g., gps error).  The process error will cause covariance between observations and likely  sampling bias.  When estimating a PDF (probability density function) from these raw observations, most techniques will assume IID (Independent and Identically Distributed), which will not be the case.  Even if you could estimate the PDF, I am not sure what you gain as you will likely use its expected value, which is a fancy way of saying the mean value the random variable will take.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4534" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:29:37.690" LastActivityDate="2016-06-22T21:30:25.233" CommentCount="0" />

The number of moderators needed depends on the size of the community (and I think the system does the determination of this on its own).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have 20k rep, you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75189/who-are-the-diamond-moderators-and-what-is-their-role&quot;&gt;most of the tools&lt;/a&gt; moderators have. Most of the extra abilities moderators have are needed very rarely. Enough users have high enough rep to not need binding votes very frequently. We don't lock posts very often, need to suspend/delete users very often (*) and our tags are relatively clean, and I've never come close to my flag/close/delete/etc. limits. &#xA;Converting answers into comments (and better yet, the reverse ability if they allowed it) would be something I'd use occasionally, but I can flag these anyway so its no real loss. Its usually pretty easy to reach the moderators on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/214/the-velodrome&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; here anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;if we are allotted 5 moderators and one hasn't logged in for nearly 5 years, I think it is time to replace that one.&lt;/strong&gt; It may or may not be necessary for the moderation load, but as a just in case, it might be useful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'd like to note that I don't want to be a moderator -- I've got enough other things to do these days that I pretty much cast votes/flags, write comments and sometimes answers.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

In general I think all 4 of us log in at least multiple times a week, if not multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for the other mods, but when I log in most days I am no longer worried at all about posting answers, and I rarely have a question that I think is unique or universal enough that I feel like asking it. I usually get in, check my normal inbox like everyone sees, check the moderation inbox for flags or messages, maybe check the most recent posts for any obvious issues and get out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the chat, I usually don't have the ability during my working day to keep the Velodrome open. So if there are problems there I personally won't see them unless they are flagged or I am summoned with an @ message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is the current moderator activity level a problem?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm likely biased, but when I say &quot;No, it's not a problem.&quot; these are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We now have a core group of very active and helpful very high-reputation users.&lt;/strong&gt; Three of those users are now above the highest reputation threshold (25k) and can do all actions except those very few that require specific rights as a moderator. Those are primarily restricted because they grant access to contact and suspend specific users, or involve communicating directly with mods of other SE sites and the community team for help with issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review queue handling has been reasonably quick and thorough for some time.&lt;/strong&gt; In the early days of the site the moderators had to be heavily involved in reviewing all questions and answers. We seem to have arrived at a fairly well established set of &quot;norms&quot;, and like in point 1, we have a solid group of users who are actively clearing the review queue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag handling times have been fairly consistent.&lt;/strong&gt; Since the graduation of the site from Area 51, the moderator flag handling time has hovered pretty consistently around the same lag time. I'm not going to reveal what that time is, and it's likely not nearly as fast as some of the higher traffic sites. But for the amount of traffic we get, I think it's appropriate. There may be a few instances where, because all of the mods are in the western hemisphere, a flag comes in at the end of our day and none of us look at it until the next day. If users are unhappy with that lag, please reach out to us in chat and we will happily discuss it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Is the site running smoothly?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think so. There are occasional issues like a grouchy user here or there, or a spam account pops up. Those seem IMHO to be handled fairly quickly. As mods, I think we rarely take the most serious actions like warning or suspending a user without contacting each other and coming to a consensus. We may have slight differences (like I think I and one other mod may be quicker on the trigger than the other two when it comes to deleting long and chatty comment threads...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What about complex actions like tag edits that only moderators can do?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you come across a serious issue that you don't know how to handle the best thing is to find a relevant question, answer, or comment and flag it for moderator attention. Use &quot;Other&quot; and explain what is going on. A slightly less reliable alternative for something that is really not tied to a specific post would be to @ one of us in the Velodrome. We'll get notified in our inbox and be around eventually. If it's a critical problem and one of the mods is slow getting back to you, the problem can be escalated to the community team using the contact link in the site footer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Finally - Thanks to the community!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will speak on behalf of all the mods in this case.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycles.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/1267&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2026" LastActivityDate="2018-01-31T00:08:13.297" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2018" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="1" />
